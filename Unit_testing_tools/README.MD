Before you begin, make sure to run this command in your terminal to install pytest:
```
pip install -U pytest
```
Then, to run pytest, just enter:
```
pytest
```
Right now, not all of the tests should pass. Fix the function to pass all its tests! Once all your tests pass, try writing some additional unit tests of your own!

# Unit Testing Tools
- To install pytest, run pip install -U pytest in your terminal.
- You can see more information on getting started here.

### Create a test file starting with test_

- Define unit test functions that start with test_ inside the test file
- Enter pytest into your terminal in the directory of your test file and it will detect these tests for you!
- Test_ is the default - if you wish to change this, you can learn how to in this pytest configuration

- In the test output, periods represent successful unit tests and F's represent failed unit tests.
- Since all you see is what test functions failed, it's wise to have only one assert statement per test.
- Otherwise, you wouldn't know exactly how many tests failed, and which tests failed.

- Your tests won't be stopped by failed assert statements, but it will stop if you have syntax errors.

Test Driven Development and Data Science
TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT: writing tests before you write the code that’s being tested. Your test would fail at first, and you’ll know you’ve finished implementing a task when this test passes.
Tests can check for all the different scenarios and edge cases you can think of, before even starting to write your function. This way, when you do start implementing your function, you can run this test to get immediate feedback on whether it works or not in all the ways you can think of, as you tweak your function.
When refactoring or adding to your code, tests help you rest assured that the rest of your code didn't break while you were making those changes. Tests also helps ensure that your function behavior is repeatable, regardless of external parameters, such as hardware and time.
Test driven development for data science is relatively new and has a lot of experimentation and breakthroughs appearing, which you can learn more about in the resources below.
