# Lesson Outline

## Object-oriented programming syntax

* procedural vs object-oriented programming
* classes, objects, methods and attributes
* coding a class
*  magic methods
*  inheritance

## Using object-oriented programming to make a Python package

* making a package
* tour of scikit-learn source code
* putting your package on PyPi

### Why Object-Oriented Programming?

```
Object-oriented programming has a few benefits over procedural programming,
which is the programming style you most likely first learned. As you'll see in this lesson,

* object-oriented programming allows you to create large, modular programs that can easily expand over time;
* object-oriented programs hide the implementation from the end-user.

```
> Consider Python packages like Scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy.
> These are all Python packages built with object-oriented programming.
> Scikit-learn, for example, is a relatively large and complex package built with object-oriented programming.
> This package has expanded over the years with new functionality and new algorithms.
